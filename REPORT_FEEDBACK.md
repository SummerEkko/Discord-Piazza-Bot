| ITEM | SCORE | FEEDBACK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PRESENTATION** | 21.2/25 | Sending the updates on a timer makes sense â€” would be nice to also request the scores through the bot.  Are modifications to how the bot works done in code or can it be done through the Bot).  The speed of the audio is a little too fast. |
| **PEER PRESENTATION EVALUATIONS** | 10.0/10 | (If you did 4 or more, your bonus will be on your individual moodle grade.) |
| **REPORT** | 15.0/15 |  |
| **360 PEER EVALUATION** | 50.0/50 | (If your moodle score is significantly lower than your team score, you might not have submitted a 360 peer evaluation.) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Total** | 96.25/100 |  |
