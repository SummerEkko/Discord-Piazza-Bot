## Acceptance Testing

See [ACCEPTANCE.md](ACCEPTANCE.md) for our acceptance tests.

## Exploratory Testing and Code Inspection

Our bot does not run on any hardcoded/mocking data. We only use mocking data for unit testing, since it is impossible to perform unit tests otherwise.

See our iteration worksheet at [WORKSHEET.md](WORKSHEET.md) and our meeting notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VgVPGERCl8Ig4kG48JwFcjqe_AqHXk9osnC4lFbZeR0/edit?usp=sharing).
