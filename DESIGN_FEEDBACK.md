| **Storyboard** | 14.0/15 | Storyboard is good overall, but should be more user centered. |
| **Architecture + Additional Patterns** | 20.0/30 | Architectural design looks good, but I don't see a discussion of additional patterns.  Also, What you have for an architecture diagram is fine, but the milestone requires "This section should be several diagrams" |
