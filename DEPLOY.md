# Deploy Milestone

## Deployment

See [Deployment.md](Deployment.md) for instructions on how to deploy our bot. We have submitted credentials and tokens through the Google form.

## Acceptance Testing

See [ACCEPTANCE.md](ACCEPTANCE.md) for our acceptance tests.

## Exploratory Testing and Code Inspection

Our bot does not run on any hardcoded/mocking data. We only use mocking data for unit testing, since it is impossible to perform unit tests otherwise.

See our iteration worksheet at [WORKSHEET.md](WORKSHEET.md) and our meeting notes here.
